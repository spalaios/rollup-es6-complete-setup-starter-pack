1) Basic rollup build process --> follow the link https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#creating-your-first-bundle
Note: this basic rollup  only uses es6 features.So inorder to transpile it to es5 use babel-setup with rollup

2)added watch feature provided by rollup
command added as npm watch as rollup -c watch

3)setting up babel for transpiling in rollup

- intall the following packages
    //this is the core of the babel on which many other babel packages are dependent
    "@babel/core": "^7.1.0",

    //This plugin contains helper functions thatâ€™ll be placed at the top of the generated code
    "@babel/plugin-external-helpers": "^7.0.0",

    //this tells babel how to transpile es6 basically it is a collection of plugins 
    //instead of manually installing each plugins one by one we can use the preset
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.1.0",


    //this plugin tells rollup js to use babel while transpiling
    "rollup-plugin-babel": "^4.0.3"

- look at the rollup.config.js to see how those above packages are used

- set up the .babelrc file 
    {
    "presets": [
        [
            "@babel/preset-env", 
            {
                "modules": false
            }
        ]
    ],
    "plugins": [
        "@babel/external-helpers"
    ]
}

4)Using source maps --> follow this link to know about source maps : https://www.schneems.com/2017/11/14/wtf-is-a-source-map/
    
    in rollup.config.js under the output object add a property named sourcemap: true
    this will generate a seperate source map bundle file at the ouput path of your output file and will also place the mapping text at the bottom of your final output file.
    option of source: 'inline' will generate the source at the bottom of your output file.

5)Eslint
