1) Basic rollup build process --> follow the link https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#creating-your-first-bundle
Note: this basic rollup  only uses es6 features.So inorder to transpile it to es5 use babel-setup with rollup

2)added watch feature provided by rollup
command added as npm watch as rollup -c watch

3)setting up babel for transpiling in rollup

- intall the following packages
    //this is the core of the babel on which many other babel packages are dependent
    "@babel/core": "^7.1.0",

    //This plugin contains helper functions thatâ€™ll be placed at the top of the generated code
    "@babel/plugin-external-helpers": "^7.0.0",

    //this tells babel how to transpile es6 basically it is a collection of plugins 
    //instead of manually installing each plugins one by one we can use the preset
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.1.0",


    //this plugin tells rollup js to use babel while transpiling
    "rollup-plugin-babel": "^4.0.3"

- set up the .babelrc file 
    {
    "presets": [
        [
            "@babel/preset-env", 
            {
                "modules": false
            }
        ]
    ],
    "plugins": [
        "@babel/external-helpers"
    ]
}
